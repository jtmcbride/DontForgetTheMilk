# Don't Forget The Milk

[Don't Forget The Milk Live Site](http://dontforgetmilk.herokuapp.com)


Don't Forget The Milk is a sigle page web application allowing users to make and organize to-do lists. It is inspired by Remember The Milk. It is built on a React/Redux frontend with a Ruby on Rails and Postgres backend.

## Features

 Don't Forget The Milk allows users to:

* Create, edit and delete to-do lists
* Create, edit and delete tasks in to-do lists
* Edit the name, priority, start date, due date, time estimate and completion of a task.
* Move tasks between lists.
* View a summary of a list which includes: number of completed and incomplete tasks, total time of tasks and number of overdue tasks
* Sort tasks by priority, due date, start date, date created, or time estimate
* Search for tasks
* View all tasks or tasks sorted by due date of today or in the next week

## Future Features

I plan to add the following features to Don't Forget the Milk:

* Users can add locations to tasks and view tasks by location using the Google Places API
* Users receive notification emails reminding them of tasks due or starting the current day
* Users can add tags to tasks and view tasks based on tags
* Users can create smart lists based on inclusion or exclusion of words
